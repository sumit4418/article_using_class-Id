            <td>They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal stylesheets, as each inline style you create must be edited separately if you’re making a design change.</td>
            <td>The rules only apply to that page, but you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</td>

            <td>This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website. By editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at once.</td>

            <td>inline CSS in HTML can be useful in some situations. For example, in cases where you don’t have access to CSS files or need to apply styles for a single element only.</td>
            <td>Since you’ll only add the code within the same HTML file, you don’t need to upload multiple files.</td>
            <td>Since the CSS code is in a separate document, your HTML files will have a cleaner structure and are smaller in size.</td>

            <td>You don’t need to create and upload a separate document as in the external style.</td>
